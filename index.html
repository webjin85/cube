			<h4 class="sub">CUBE Autonomous car Security Platform based on Blockchain</h4>
			<p>Autonomous cars rely heavily on wireless communication techniques, such as vehicle-to-vehicle, navigation route information, GPS, and other driving data. Autonomous cars continuously communicate with various sites to remotely monitor their internal and outside states. These various network accesses increase the risk of malicious attacks on autonomous vehicles. Cube solves the problem of these autonomous vehicles’ security by using blockchain technologies, AI-based deep learning and quantum hash cryptography.</p>
			<p>In the future, the $770 billion autonomous automotive market will see Cube as the first user of blockchain-based security. We will provide an autonomous vehicle security platform to companies such as automotive manufacturers, and related firms, such as Google and Uber.</p>

					<h4 class="sub">The simplest way to have a professioanal webpage.</h4>
					<p>The key to Blockchain is that technology ensures trust. CUBE uses block-chain technology to ensure the security of autonomous mobile networks. </p>
					<p>In the operation of autonomous vehicles, many IOTs provide information to autonomous vehicles. The attacker seeks to gain access to the network between an autonomous car and IoT or traffic center. In such instances, the hash of the infected binary differs from the hash included in the multisig transaction which is signed by the SW provider and the OEM. Thus, the vehicles can readily detect such an attack before installing the infected SW update. Distribution of a false update by claiming to be the OEM or SW update provider could be ceased since the overlay nodes are aware of the Public Key of the OEM and the SW update provider. Therefore, the attacker cannot claim to be either of these entities as it requires the private key associated with the Public Key of the relevant entities.</p>

					<h4 class="sub">AI Deep - Learning Layer</h4>
					<p>The second layer is the AI layer. This layer will be applied partly from 2019, and will be commercialized from 2020.At present, network security is a passive system that collects patches to prevent the reuse of methods used in past cases of hacking.</p>
					<p> Cube will train, in supervisor mode, using the past as a primary case to construct a defense system against future attacks by creating malicious attack scenarios that are likely to be made hundreds of millions of times. Cube’s intrusion detection system, using deep neural networks for vehicle network security, has two parts, a discriminative deep architecture and a generative deep architecture, depending on how the architectures are exploited.</p>
					<p>After the pre-training phase is complete, fine-tuning will be performed using the gradient descent method with supervised learning. While blockchain is used as the first and main security method, AI deep learning-based security will guarantee the double defense system.</p>

					<h4 class="sub">Quantum Hashing Cryptography Layer</h4>
					<p>Blockchain has improved security by using hashes appropriately. However, there is a growing concern that as the performance of computers grows rapidly, hash cryptography can become a limitation. Cube develops quantum cryptography to prevent malicious attacks against autonomous vehicles. This Quantum Cryptography will contribute not only to the autonomous drive, but also to the overall upgrade of the entire Blockchain technology. This Quantum Hashing Cryptography Layer will be applied from 2022.</p>
					<p>Cube's quantum hash technology will provide an important opportunity to ensure a high level of security throughout the blockchain field using simple hash technology. Cube increases the level of security by using continuously changing quantum characteristics, The characteristics that the data receive depend on the angle of polarization; further, the characteristics of the data are destroyed at the moment of a malicious attack.</p>

				<h4 class="sub">CUBE Technology Market Application Plan</h4>

				<strong>Over The Air Market (From 2018)</strong>
				<p>OTA technology is a technology that can remotely upgrade existing automotive software. Automotive software can improve performance and patch bugs through upgrades. CUBE will provide software diagnostics and installation and bug patches of existing automotive software remotely with OTA technology based on blockchains.</p>

				<strong>Autonomous Vehicle Security Platform (2019)</strong>
				<p>There are plans to sell the autonomous vehicle security platform technology that is based on blockchain in 2019. The two major sales models will include CUBE's sales of technology licenses and the sales of application technologies.</p>

					<li>The cube must be audited annually by a well-known accounting firm worldwide.</li>
					<li>Cube shall publish monthly operational and financial reports to share the operational status of the company with its contributors.</li>
					<li>Cube shall distribute a monthly report to share important company updates.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4 class="sub">Higher Valuation Policy</h4>
				<p>To protect its contributors and provide them with higer profits, Cube will be operated as follows</p>
				<ul class="dot_list">
					<li>The executive managers of Cube are bound by a lock-up system, which means they are not entitled to make token sales for one year. The lock-up policy is intended to make sure the executive managers receive suitable rewards only after the company grows enough.</li>
					<li>Cube should strictly control the use of its budget to stably increase the value of Cube tokens.</li>
					<li>Cube’s business model should always constructed to create high actual revenue. The profit model involves a mixed short- and long-term model so that it maintains high valuation.</li>
